Static problem classified as
- "simple" problems involving single polymer chains which are basically "exactly soluble" by the standard methods.
    - configurational statistics at $\Theta$-point
- Others, like excluded volume problem

## Brief summary of configuration statistics
### Background
For a single chain in solution, different interaction(forces) must be considered
1. The polymer-solvent interaction
2. The osmotic forces
3. Polymer-polymer interaction
    - a. short-range interaction
    - b. long-range interaction

At $\Theta$ temperature, 1 and 2 exactly cancel 3b. Thus only 3a remains.
